## Why did we choose to move?
After extensive consultation with almost every member, and after the completion of the member satisfaction survey, it's clear there were a few common frustrations. The main ones were the lack of space for storage, not enough space to work on projects, and difficulties using the space while workshops are going on. In addition, some of our newer or most requested tools like a CNC router and basic woodworking tools are not suitable at all for the current space.

Due to all of the above, and the expiry of our 12 month lease at the end of October, we decided to make the move now. Whilst it may be a little trickier for those who drive in, we think it's a good compromise overall.

## Benefits of the new space
* Significantly larger - about FOUR times the space, including a dedicated meeting room, and our own kitchen and bathroom
* Downstairs workshop area for simple woodworking projects and the new CNC router
* Suitable for 24/7 access
* More central - much better public and active transport options
* Two dedicated, on-site carparks & free motorcycle parking
* Amazing restaurant downstairs, and dozens more nearby

## Negatives of the new space
* Parking is more tricky being closer to the city
* Not wheelchair accessible (just like the current place). We looked everywhere, but couldn't find an affordable place with an accessible entrance. We're going to investiate ways of funding a wheelchair lift for the stairs (such as a grant or gofundme), but it may not be possible.
