# Fee Schedule
Here is a list of all the fees that may be payable as a member or user of our facilities.

## Refunds & Cancellations
This refund policy does not override or exclude your rights under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). If goods and services you purchase from BMS are faulty or not fit for purpose, you may be entitled to a refund under ACL.

If you wish to cancel your membership, you can do so from our member portal [here](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space). You can cancel at any time after your minimum membership period has lapsed (this may differ depending on your plan). Your membership will be automatically terminated at the end of your current billing cycle after you request cancellation. We do not give refunds for unused membership part way through a billing cycle.

Materials and tool usage charges are not refundable outside of exceptional circumstances or where required under ACL. Spacebucks top-ups or complimentary credits are final and cannot be refunded or converted to cash.

## Membership Fees
To maintain membership, you are required to pay your membership fees by the due date of your billing period. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of your membership. If you have any problems paying for your membership please let us know!

All membership plans have a 3 month minimum initial signup period. After 3 months of membership, you can cancel at anytime from the member portal.

#### Concession Discount

We offer discounted rates to enable more equitable access to our community. To be eligible for our discounted concession rates, you must prove that you're a current full-time student or concession cardholder. If you stop meeting these requirements, please notify us as soon as possible. The committee has the right to ask for proof at most twice per year to verify you're still entitled to receive the concession discount.

## Late / No Show Fee
Unfortunately due to repeated no shows and members being late to appointments, we've had to implement a late fee. This fee applies to all bookings made for time with a BMS volunteer and does not include tool bookings (like for using the laser cutter).

**If you:**
* do not show up for a booked appointment
* are more than 10 minutes late to a booked appointment
* give less than 12 hours notice to cancel a booked appointment (without a good reason)

We will charge your payment method on file a no show fee. This fee depends on your membership plan:

Maker Lite or concession: **$20**
Other Plans: **$40**

## Lost Card Fee
If you lose your swipe card / swipe fob, you'll have to pay a fee for a new one. You must let us know as soon as you've lost it so we can remove it from your profile. If someone finds and uses it, you are responsible for any damage or theft that occurs.

Before we can issue a replacement card you'll have to pay a fee. This covers some of the cost of the replacement card and the time/effort required to organise it and depends on your membership plan:

Maker Lite or concession: **$10**
Other Plans: **$20**

## Outside Hours Lockout Fee
If you are locked out of the space during the day between 7am and 7pm, you can call the lockouts number or ask on Discord. If a volunteer is available, they will answer and can facilitate remote access at their discretion for free.

If you are locked out of the space over night between 7pm and 7am, you can call the lockouts number. If a volunteer is available, they will answer and can facilitate remote access at their discretion for a fee:

* Between 7pm to midnight - **$40**
* between midnight to 7am - **$100**

**Note:** the lockout service is available on a "best effort" basis meaning it may not be available at all times, especially in the early hours of the morning. It depends on the availability/willingness of our volunteers to respond. This fee is paid directly to the volunteer who responds (if any) for the inconvenience of being interrupted/woken up.


## Tool Usage Fees
Some tools may incur usage fees to cover maintenance costs and consumables usage. Most tools are included in your membership, but please check its wiki page to avoid any surprises. This section is not part of this policy and is here for reference only.

If you fail to pay for tool usage within a reasonable amount of time (generally considered 24 hours) we may terminate your membership and attempt to recover the costs from your payment method on file. 

Here is a list of tools with usage fees:
* [Lasercutter](/tools/digifab/lasercutter) $10/hr BYO material
* [3D Printers (Filament)](/tools/digifab/adventurer4) $1.50/hr or $40/kg - filament included
* [3D Printers (Resin)](/tools/digifab/elegoomars2pro) $2/hr - resin included
