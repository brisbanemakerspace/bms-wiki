# Infrastructure Working Group
Working Groups are how we get stuff done in a decentralised, but accountable way. Welcome to the *Infrastructure* Working Group's wiki page.

# Purpose
The Infrastructure Working Group is responsible for maintaining and improving the physical and digital infrastructure of our space. This includes overseeing and upgrading essential facilities such as Wi-Fi networks, door locks, servers, and other technological systems that are crucial for the smooth operation of the space. Our goal is to ensure reliable and easy to use infrastructure, enabling a seamless experience for all members.

# Members
* Jaimyn Mauer (Facilitator)
* Brendan Halliday (Authorised Maintainer)

# Budgets
## Discretionary Budget
This budget can be spent on approval by the Facilitator for any reason. However, it is typically used for small and inconsistent expenses like restocking consumables or minor repairs.

### Amount
$100/mth non-accruing

## Emergency Repair Budget
This budget can be spent on approval by the Facilitator and at least one other member to organise emergency repairs or replacement of critical space infrastructure like WiFi routers, door locks, broken windows etc.

### Amount
$500 once off - after each incident, expenditure needs to be ratified and the budget reset at a General Meeting.

# Policies
## 1. Changes to core space infrastructure
1. Core space infrastructure is defined as any piece of physical or digital infrastructure that would cause significant disruption to most members if it stopped working as intended. Examples include WiFi, door locks, forum software, etc.

2. Any changes to core space infrastructure must be approved by the Facilitator or someone authorised as a maintainer of infrastructure.
