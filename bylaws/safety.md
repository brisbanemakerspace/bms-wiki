# Introduction
You can't work on projects when you're injured! But also, it's no fun for anyone. At Brisbane Makerspace, safety is extremely important. In an environment like ours, there are certain risks that a lot of people aren't normally exposed to.

## 1. Safety Incidents
1. If a safety incident or near-miss occurs, no matter how small, it must be reported via the member portal or email so that it can be acted upon. Try to capture as many details as possible. We'll keep a record of incidents so we can improve our documentation and procedures.

## 2. Safety Risks
1. You must never do anything that poses an unreasonable safety risk.

2. If you see someone about to do something that poses an unreasonable safety risk, you should politely but firmly advise them to stop and explain why. You should report the matter to the committee if they continue.

## 3. Drugs and Alcohol
1. You must never be under the influence of any illegal drugs or substances while on site. You will be asked to leave if you are caught using or being under the influence of an illegal drug or substance.

2. You must never use a tool whilst under the influence of alcohol or any medication/drug (prescription or otherwise) that may impact your ability to safely operate that tool.
  	1. It is a breach of this section to operate a tool if you have any level of detectable blood alcohol concentration.

3. Storing or consuming alcohol on site is prohibited outside of a specific social event where consuming alcohol has been permitted by the committee. The committee may put reasonable conditions on the consumption of alcohol. Any member of the committee has the power to ask any person unduly intoxicated to leave at any time.

## 4. Aerosols and Odorous Chemicals
1. You must not use any aerosols (like spray paint etc.) or any substance that produces an unpleasant smell in the upstairs workspace, or any enclosed area. You are only permitted to use these aerosols/substances in the outside area and with enough ventilation.
	1. Exceptions to this policy include household cleaning products (and similar) that are provided by BMS like air freshener, bug spray, surface cleaner, etc.

## 5. Tools
The use of any tool poses certain risks. Some are low risk like a pair of scissors, and others are high risk such as our laser cutter. We try to reduce the chances of any safety incidents happening through extensive training, documentation, and procedures.

1. It is a requirement before using a tool for the first time, that you read its wiki page if it has one, and complete any required inductions. Our [Tool Inductions](/policies/inductions) policy explains how our traffic light induction system works.

2. Some tools have a specific procedure that must be followed every time you use the tool. A summary of the most important steps is attached to some of these tools and is called "just in time documentation" (or JIT doc for short). If you see a JIT doc, you are required to follow all relevant steps.

## 6. Clothing and PPE
1. Shoes are required to be worn at all times while on site.

2. Closed in shoes are required to be worn when working in the basement area, operating red tools, handheld power tools, or using heavy hand tools.

3. We recommend that you remove all jewellery and tie up long hair before working with tools, and require this on all tools that would pose a risk otherwise.

4. We have a range of basic PPE such as safety glasses and gloves. You are encouraged to bring your own PPE as it's likely to be more comfortable and better fitting. We require that you wear appropriate PPE for what you are doing at all times.

## 7. Tidy Workspaces
1. All workspaces must be left clean and tidy both during and after, you are using them. An untidy workspace is a common cause of safety incidents and should be avoided.

2. Members must never block or obstruct a doorway or exit path for any length of time. 

## 8. Electrical Work
1. All electrical work that requires an electrical license must be completed by someone who holds that license (e.g. an electrician). Most of the time, this means any project where voltages above 120v DC or 50v RMS AC are present.

## 9. Explosive & Flammables Goods Storage
1. Our lease disallows storing explosive or flammable goods on site due to the fire risk. As such, members are prohibited from storing any chemical, substance, or item on site that carries a dangerous goods warning label relating to fire or explosion.
	1. "Pre-Approved Chemicals & Substances" in the section below are exempt from this policy.

2. There is also a limit on the amount of batteries a member may store on site. Members must not store more than a total of 100Wh of batteries at any one time unless you have permission in writing from the committee. This balances the fire safety risk batteries pose.
	1. sealed battery packs (such as from power tools, power banks, etc.) in good condition that are unmodified from the original manufacturer are exempt from this rule.

## 10. Chemicals & Dangerous Substances
Due to the nature of the tools and resources available, we sometimes have to deal with chemicals and dangerous substances. We have requirements in place to ensure we maintain a safe workshop and that we have the necessary documentation in the event of an incident.

1. All chemicals and dangerous substances that are bought on site **must** have an MSDS inserted into the MSDS folder near the chemical storage area.

2. Before bringing something new on-site, you must have permission from the Head Maker to do so. A chemical or dangerous substance is not allowed to be bought on-site, even temporarily, without a relevant MSDS and approval from the Head Maker.

3. If you bring any chenmical or dangerous subtance on-site, you are responsible for removing it from site, and safely/legally disposing of it.

## 11. Pre-Approved Chemicals & Substances
The following list presents a low enough risk to be pre-approved. That means anything on this list is allowed to be bought on-site and used, as long as you follow the relevant safety procedures.

1. When dealing with anything that is at risk of being splashed or spilt, at a minimum, you must wear gloves and safety glasses.

2. The list of pre-approved chemicals and substances:

* [Acetone](/msds/diggers_acetone.pdf)
* [Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) - any strength](/msds/sydney_solvents_ipa_sds.pdf)
* [Methylated Spirits](/msds/diggers_methylated_spirits.pdf)
* Casting resins (for woodwork, art, etc.) - any specific brand must be inserted into the MSDS folder if it isn't already there.
* [PVA Glue](/msds/j_burrows_&_studymate_pva_glue_sds.pdf)
* [Nova3D 3D printer resin](/msds/405nm_resin.pdf)
* [eSUN ABS+ 3D printer filament](/msds/esun_abs_plus_filament.pdf)
* [eSUN PLA+ 3D printer filament](/msds/esun_pla_plus_filament.pdf)
