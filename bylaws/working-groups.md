# Working Groups
Working Groups are how we get stuff done in a decentralised, but accountable way. Each Working Group looks after a certain area of the space, and is accountable to the Head Maker and Committee.

# Requirements
These are the minimum requirements to exist and operate as a Working Group:
1. A well defined purpose that is specific and not too broad (e.g. to look after the woodworking area, or to manage safety around the space).
2. At least two named volunteers who commit to running the Working Group, with one designated as the Facilitator for the purpose of conducting meetings and liasing the Head Maker.
3. The Facilitator must regularly meet with the Head Maker and is accountable for making sure everything is running smoothly within that Working Group.
4. A wiki page with the following information:
		1. The Working Group name.
    2. A well defined purpose.
    3. A list of all the current members.
    4. A list of all the budgets they can spend and how.
    5. A list of any policies that apply to resources they manage.

# Assumed Responsibilities
The following is a list of assumed responsibilities that a Working Group is typically responsible for:
1. General upkeep and tidying of it's areas.
2. Spending budgets that were allocated to them at a General Meeting.
3. Maintaining the tools and resources in it's area (ie fixing/calibrating tools, etc.).
4. Creating the tool inductions and authorising members to run inductions for the tools in it's area.

# Create or remove a Working Group
To create or remove a new Working Group, a motion needs to be carried either at a General Meeting or Committee Meeting. In order for a new Working Group to be approved, the meeting needs to be satisfied that all requirements above are met.

# Membership
Membership to a Working Group is open to all members of the association (including non-voting members). However, only members entitled to vote at a General Meeting may vote on motions.

# Working Group Policies
A Working Group can define and enforce policies (considered by-laws under our constitution) in line with the following requirements.

Any Working Group policy:
1. can be set aside or ammended at a General Meeting or Committee Meeting; and
2. is only valid if it is directly related to the Working Group's purpose, and is to help manage it's tools and resources; and
3. must be passed by carrying a motion using the consensus procedure at a Working Group meeting; and
4. does not unreasonably limit or restrict how a member can utilise a resource; and
5. does not conflict with an existing policy approved at a General Meeting or Committee Meeting.

# Working Group Meetings
Working Group meetings:
1. are open for attendance by any member of the association; and
2. can be held as often as necessary and called by any Working Group member by posting a notice for a meeting on the forum with 7 days notice; and
3. can pass motions solely relating to Working Group policies as defined above, or that determine how an existing approved budget can be spent; and
4. have no quorum other than the minimum two members required to exist; and
5. must follow all meeting procedures and requirements from our constitution and the Meetings policy, including votes to be conducted by way of consensus; and
6. must publish detailed and accurate minutes on the wiki within a reasonable time after any meeting.
