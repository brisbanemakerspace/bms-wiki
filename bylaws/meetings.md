# Meetings
Please see the [constitution](/constitution#h-38-procedure-and-voting-at-general-meeting) (Sections 35-39) for information on how meetings are required to be run and how our consensus voting process works.

## Regular meeting time
The organisation should host a regular general meeting on the first and third Monday of each month at 8pm. However, additional meetings may be held, or regular meetings may be skipped/moved as deemed necessary due to operational requirements like holidays etc.

## Motions that require notice
Some agenda items must be published with a certain amount of notice to be added to the agenda for a meeting. Items that fail to meet this requirement must be tabled for the next general meeting.

Days includes the day of the meeting, and do not have to be a full 24 hour period. E.g. 3 days of notice for a meeting at 8pm on Monday would require publication prior to midnight on the Friday beforehand.

Items requiring 3 days notice:
* All items that require a vote (including a vote by consensus).


## Motions that incur costs
All motions that incur a cost to the organisation have special rules that must be followed.

Motions that incur a cost:

1. Automatically lapse after 3 months from the date the motion was carried if the cost has not been inccured yet, or action has not been taken to incur that cost at a later date by way of a contract or formal agreement (ie pre-order placed, etc.).
2. Must receive written approval from the Treasurer, Head Maker, or Committee before the cost may be incurred, which may be delayed or witheld if operational cashflow does not allow the organisation to incur that cost.
3. If the cost is to acquire or otherwise put in service a tool or machine, a detailed plan of action including responsible person(s), appropriate electrical/extra costs have been accounted for, tool documentation, and a timeline must form part of the motion.

## Motions that change policy
Motions that change or create policy must present the exact wording that is proposed in writing and with enough notice as defined above. Minor alterations to the proposed exact wording is permitted on the floor of a meeting, as long as the substance of those changes is captured in the minutes.

Policy changes that only correct spelling mistakes or layout/formatting and don't change the substance or meaning of a policy are permitted without a motion. If any change is found to alter the substance or meaning of a policy, that change is not valid and the policy prior to the change is deemed still in force.
