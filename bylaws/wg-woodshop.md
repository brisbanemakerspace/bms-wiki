# Woodshop Working Group
Working Groups are how we get stuff done in a decentralised, but accountable way. Welcome to the *Woodshop* Working Group's wiki page.

# Purpose
The Woodshop Working Group is dedicated to managing and enhancing the woodshop facilities at BMS. Our goal is to ensure a safe and well-organized environment for all members interested in woodworking. This includes maintaining and upgrading tools and equipment, fostering a culture of safety and skill-building, and facilitating workshops and projects that engage and benefit the community.

This budget can be spent on approval by the Facilitator for any reason. However, it is typically used for small and inconsistent expenses like restocking consumables or minor repairs.

### Amount
$100/mth non-accruing

# Policies
## 1. Woodshop Layout
Any changes to the layout of the woodshop (including the position of permanent extension leads/work tables etc.) must be approved by the Facilitator or at a Working Group meeting.
