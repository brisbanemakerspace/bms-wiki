# Storage at BMS
We have very limited space on site, so this storage policy explains what our expectations and requirements are.

## 1. Storage Locations
1. Storage of personal items is not permitted anywhere on-site, except where permitted in the policy below, or as permitted by a working group policy.

2. You may not store any dangerous substances or chemicals anywhere on site without written permission from the Head Maker or unless another policy explicitly permits you to.

3. Members are not permitted to leave food on site except for items stored in the refrigerator on a temporary basis, unless permission is granted from the committee. Members should leave all food scraps in the large main bin or take it directly out to the wheelie bins.

## 2. Storage in Member Storage Shelves
1. You can claim up to one cube in the member storage shelves as long as you are a member and require one. You can do so on a permanent or temporary basis.

2. To claim a permanent spot, let the head maker know so a label can be printed. To claim a temporary spot, store your items and affix a Green Ticket as explained below.

3. All items stored must fit entirely within the cube without sticking out and must not cause a hazard or nuisance to another member.

 _Examples of following this policy:_
 * You have one member storage box filled with some tools / materials and a permanent label
 * You have some materials temporarily stored in one storage box with a green ticket

 _Examples of not following this policy:_
 * You have more than one member storage box filled with items
 * You have a long piece of wood that sticks out of your member storage box

## 2A. Storage in Member Private Desks / Private Shelves
1. If your membership plan allows for one, you can exclusively claim a desk or shelve(s) in consultation with the head maker.

2. You may store personal items on top of or underneath your exclusively claimed desk or shelves, as long as those items:
	1. do not protude from the boundary of the desk, and
	2. are not stored directly on the floor (all items must be in a _plastic or metal_ container or on a shelf), and
	3. do not cause a safety hazard or nusiance to any other members, and
	4. in the case of a desk, do not cause the chair to stick out more than it normally would.
 
 _Examples of following this policy:_
 * You have two small stackable plastic containers that fit entirely underneath your desk
 * Any extra items that don't fit under your desk, you take home with you after your visit

 _Examples of not following this policy:_
 * Storing cardboard boxes on the ground under your desk
 * Leaving a pile of items on your desk stacked so high a draught may knock it over
 * Items sticking out from underneath or on top of your desk or shelves

## 3. Temporary Project Storage
We recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on-site while the paint is drying or glue is setting, etc.

1. You are permitted to leave one project on site if it's too big to fit in your storage cube and you can't reasonably transport it home.
		1. This project must not be stored on a workspace and must be stored out of the way so as not to inconvenience another member.

2. You must attach a Green Ticket to all items stored outside of a permanent storage cube.

Examples of following this policy:
* You leave a painting that you've been working on above the member storage shelves with a Green Ticket on it, and you come back to collect it in a few days.
* You store a large sheet of wood behind the vending machine with a Green Ticket on it as it's too big to take home on the bus. You come back 6 weeks later to use it throw out the rest of the offcuts.

Examples of not following this policy:
* You leave a 3D print with glue waiting to dry above the member storage shelves but forget to put a Green Ticket on it.
* You leave your project on a workspace and put a Green Ticket on it.
* You forgot about a sheet you had stored behind the electronics shelves and after 3 months it got red ticketed (so someone else claimed it to save it being thrown out).

## 3A Temporary Material Sheet Storage
This policy aims to provide some guidance on where and how to store sheet materials that are too large for member storage.

1. You may store sheets of material (used or unused) upright:
* behind or in between the vending machines; or
* behind the electronics shelves; or
* next to the member storage shelves on the left; or
* next to the laser cutter on the left; or
* any other place a working group decides that is out of the way and doesn’t cause a safety hazard.
2. Every individual sheet (or if they are securely grouped together, the whole group) must have a green ticket attached to it.
3. Unlike regular green tickets, sheet materials have a 3 month expiry on them. However, you will have to renew the green ticket every 3 months or you risk it being red ticketed.
4. A soft limit of 5 sheets per member is considered reasonable and may be enforced if storage space becomes limited.
5. As explained elsewhere in this policy, storing any item at BMS is done at your own risk and there is no guarantee someone doesn’t come along and take your materials or that they don’t get damaged. Make sure they’re clearly labeled or they’re fair game!

Examples of following this policy:
* You store a large sheet of wood behind the vending machine with a Green Ticket on it as it's too big to take home on the bus. You come back 6 weeks later to use it throw out the rest of the offcuts.

Examples of not following this policy:
* You forgot about a sheet you had stored behind the electronics shelves and after 3 months it got red ticketed (so someone else claimed it to save it being thrown out).

## 4. Large Project Storage
1. You may store one large project on site, at the discretion of the Head Maker, or by carrying a motion at a general meeting.
2. You must not exceed the time limit imposed, which may not be longer than 3 months, unless a longer time is approved at a general meeting.
		1. If the approved time limit is exceeded, it may be disposed of off site.
3. You must store it in the way approved by the Head Maker or the motion carried at a general meeting, and it must always have a Green Ticket attached to all loose parts of it.
4. A security bond may be required to be collected prior to the project coming on site; and
		1.  may be an amount up to the estimated cost of having a professional remove your project and dispose of it; and
    2. cannot be returned until the project has been removed off site; and
    3. may be partially returned if a cost was incurred by the makerspace to remove it off site.

# Tickets

If you want to print more tickets (or use the template for a different makerspace) the most up to date templates can be found in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/109a1smq30gtY9oBmITfDE1UxCnNJi5Ly?usp=sharing).

## 5. Green Ticket
1. Green tickets are required to be attached to all items left on-site outside of your permanent and labelled storage cube.

2. Green Tickets allow you to store something on site for up to 30 days at a time and must be renewed with a new one prior to expiry.

3. Any item found with an expired green ticket, or no ticket, will be issued with a red ticket.

## 6. Red Ticket
1. Red tickets offer a formal warning that this item is not allowed to be here. Once a red ticket has been attached to an item, you have 14 days to rectify the problem identified. You must either attach a green ticket to it (if appropriate) or remove it off-site, etc.

2. A good faith effort must be made to find out and contact the owner of the item when a red ticket is attached to it, and throughout the 14 day period it is attached. This may be satisfied by posting an image on Discord if the owner is unknown.

3. Once a red ticket ticket has expired, the makerspace may choose to dispose of the item or handle it as they see fit.

4. The 14 day time period does not apply to items improperly stored that present an immediate health risk or hazard.

## 7. Yellow Ticket
Typically we repair tools pretty quickly, but sometimes we need to wait on parts etc.

1. If a tool can't be safely used, it must have a Yellow Ticket attached to it. This will explain what's wrong with the tool and when it's expected to be fixed.

2. Yellow Ticket tools are **not to be used** (unless it says otherwise on the ticket) until the ticket has been removed, or you are authorised by the relevant Working Group or Head Maker.

3. If you break a tool, or come across a tool, you are required to fill in and attach a Yellow Ticket.

## 8. Disclaimer
Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. The makerspace takes no responsibility for anything that may happen to items you leave on-site. Any items found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of after 14 days of being in breach as per the Red Ticket policy.
