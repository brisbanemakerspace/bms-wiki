# Parking Policy
Brisbane Makerspace has two assigned parking spaces. To ensure fair access to these parking spaces, members may only access them in accordance with this policy. By parking in any of our onsite parking spaces, you agree to the following conditions.

## Restrictions
* A booking is required to use any of our parking spaces.
* Members are entitled to park on site for up to 2 hours total per day, across all parking spaces.
* Whilst your car is parked in one of our parking spaces, you must remain physically on site at Brisbane Makerspace.

## Breach of these conditions
If you breach any of these conditions, your vehicle will be towed away and removed from site. You will be required to pay the towing fee (up to $271.25) directly to the tow company to release your vehicle. If your vehicle is towed you can call us on 07 2111 8684 for details on how to collect it.
