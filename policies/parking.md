# Parking Policy
Brisbane Makerspace has **two** assigned parking spaces and **one** loading bay (requires blocking in the other two spaces). To ensure fair access to these parking spaces, members may only access them in accordance with this policy. By parking in any of our designated parking spaces, you agree to follow this policy.

For tips on nearby parking locations, please see our [getting there](/getting-there) page.

These parking spaces are provided on a best effort basis for member convenience and availability is not guaranteed. BMS takes absolutely no responsibility for any damage or loss that occurs as a result of you using our parking spaces. Parking is done at your own risk.

## Restrictions
* Parking may not be used by guests or workshop attendees (although please ask if there are special circumstances).
* Members are entitled to park on site for a MAXIMUM of 6 hours total per day.
  * If you leave and come back, move to another park, etc. this does not reset the time limit.
* Whilst your car is parked in one of our parking spaces, you must remain physically on site at Brisbane Makerspace.
  * These ARE NOT car parks you can use anytime you are in the area.
  * Short trips off site (<30 minutes) to get lunch etc. is fine, but if you are gone longer than this your car may be towed.
* Brisbane Makerspace has the right to ask you to move your vehicle offsite for any reason and at any time without notice. If you are unable to do so within a reasonable time, your car may be towed.
