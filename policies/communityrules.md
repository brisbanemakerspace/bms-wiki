# Community Rules
If a rule or policy isn't big enough to get it's own page on our [list of policies](/policies), you'll find it here.

## Fair Use and Commercial Use
Brisbane Makerspace is focused on providing an amazing workshop and learning environment for *individuals*. Commercial prototyping and occasional commercial use is perfectly acceptable, as long as it doesn't impact other members.

Even for personal use, you must stay within reasonable limits and not unfairly impact other members with excessive use. For example, laser cutting (commercial or personal) projects a few times per week is fine. However, using the laser cutter for a few hours every day of the week on a regular basis is not.

If our facilities are directly used to generate a large part of your business or personal income, please reconsider if you're doing the right thing. Commercial manufacturing facilities are significantly more expensive (and more suitable) for a reason. If you're unsure, just let us know and we're happy to clarify what is or is not reasonable use. If you're using our facilities significantly more than a typical individual member, you may be asked to pay more or reduce your usage.

Our Maker Plus plan is included in this. For our Maker Lite plan, no commercial whatsoever is permitted.

## Membership Eligibility and Termination
We strive to be an accepting and inclusive place for all members of society who are interested in making amazing projects. As such, generally membership is eligible to everyone.

Sometimes, after becoming a member, someone causes unnecessary stress to our staff, or is generally causing a nuisance in our community. As such, Brisbane Makerspace reserves the right to suspend your site access or terminate your membership for breaching our rules in line with our Bad Behaviour Policy.

## Membership Fees
To maintain membership, you are required to pay your membership fees by the due date of your billing period. Failure to do so may result in suspension of your access to our facilities until payment is made. If you fall too far into arrears, we may terminate your membership entirely. If you have any problems paying for your membership please let us know, we're here to help!

In addition, we offer discounted rates to try and enable more equitable access to our community. To be eligible for our discounted concession rates, you must prove that you're a current full time student or concession card holder. If you cease meeting these requirements, please notify us as soon as possible so we can update your membership rates. If you don't notify us, and we later find out, we reserve the right to collect the difference of any unpaid fees.

## Refund/Cancellation Policy
This refund policy does not override or exclude your rights under Australian Consumer Law (ACL). If goods and services you purchase from Brisbane Makerspace are faulty or not fit for purpose, you may be entitled to a refund under ACL.

In the event that you wish to cancel your membership, you can do so from our member portal [here](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space). We do not have any mandatory notice periods for cancellation. Your membership will be automatically terminated at the end of your current billing cycle after you request cancellation. We do not give refunds for unused membership part way through a billing cycle.

All materials and tool usage charges are not refundable outside of exceptional circumstances or where required under ACL.

## Consumables
As a member, you are allowed to use any consumable we have on site (for example, glue, popsicle sticks, pens, etc.). All consumables, unless otherwise noted, are free to use. However, our Fair Use Policy (below) applies.

If you are close to breaching the fair use policy, we will try to provide a warning. If you breach our fair use policy, we reserve the right to charge you for excessive use (including the cost of excessive consumables and a restocking fee).

### Fair use of consumables
* Consumables are only to be used for personal projects and in line with our general Fair Use Poicy.
* Excessive or unreasonable amounts of consumable use are prohibited (for example, using up an entire bag of pom poms for your project).
* General commerical use of consumables is prohibited. Occasional use in commisioned projects is fine, but regular commercial use is not. Our consumables are here for member convenience, not as a cheap source for your business.

## Storage at Brisbane Makerspace
Due to the limited space available on site, there is no general storage of personal belongings or member projects permitted. However, we recognise that sometimes you may need to leave a project on site while paint is drying or glue is setting, etc. Each member is entitled to leave one project on the designated temporary storage shelf for up to 7 days at a time. If there is not enough room on the temporary storage shelf, you will have to make arrangements to transport your project home and you may not leave it on site.

If you need to leave for a short while, and will return within 2 hours, you may leave personal belongings or projects on site outside of the temporary storage shelf. However, if you do, you must ensure they are left in a safe and tidy condition, and not cluttering up a workspace. Anything that is left on site unattended, is done so at your own risk. If you choose to leave anything on site in accordance with this policy, you must label it with your name and mobile number. Brisbane Makerspace takes no reponsibility for anything that may happen to your belongings or personal projects.

Any personal belongings or member projects found to be in breach of this policy may be disposed of without warning, so please make sure you understand this policy.

## Guests
Outside of our publically advertised events, access is only available to paid up members and their guests.

If you're a member wanting to bring a guest along, you must follow these rules:
* No more than 2 people are allowed to accompany you as a guest.
* Guests are not allowed to use yellow or red tools.
* Guests under 12 are not allowed to use any tools.
* You and your guest(s) must be working on the same project - ie one project per active membership.
* Guests may be asked to leave if Brisbane Makerspace is at capacity, or they cause a nuisance.
* Guests are not permitted to work on commercial projects. All individuals working on commercial projects must have their own membership (but it's fine to bring a co-worker if they're just watching for example).

## COVID-19
Brisbane Makerspace requires all members to follow current public health orders and best practices at all times. This includes wearing masks and signing in with the QLD check in app if required by current guidelines. We recommend that all members regularly wash and sanitise their hands, and stay socially distant to other members where possible. If you refuse to follow a current public health order (such as checking in or wearing a mask), you will be refused entry or asked to leave, and issued with a warning or access suspension under our Bad Behaviour Policu.
