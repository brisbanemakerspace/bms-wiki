# Fee Schedule
Here is a list of all the fees that may be payable as a member or user of our facilities.

## Refunds & Cancellations
Our refund and cancellation policy can be found [here](https://wiki.brisbanemaker.space/en/policies/communityrules#refundcancellation-policy).

## Membership Fees
To maintain membership, you are required to pay your membership fees by the due date of your billing period. Failure to do so may result in the cancellation of your membership. If you have any problems paying for your membership please let us know!

We also offer discounted rates to enable more equitable access to our community. To be eligible for our discounted concession rates, you must prove that you're a current full-time student or concession cardholder. If you stop meeting these requirements, please notify us as soon as possible.

Note: unless required by law, we do not refund payment processing fees. All payments made online incur a 2% fee (that we include in the price).

### Maker Lite
Fee: $39/mth

* Commercial use is not permitted ([Fair Use Policy](/policies/fair-use) applies)
* Commissioned projects where a fee is paid or commercial value is generated are NOT permitted

### Maker Plus
Fee: $59/mth

* Limited commercial use (see our [Fair Use Policy](/policies/fair-use))

### Maker Plus (Concession)
Fee: $39/mth

* Limited commercial use (see our [Fair Use Policy](/policies/fair-use))
* Must be currently studying full time or hold a concession card

## Late / No Show Fee
Unfortunately due to repeated no shows and members being significantly late to booked appointments, we've had to implement a late fee. This late fee applies to all members, or people who've applied for membership. This policy applies to all bookings made for time with a BMS staff member and does not include tool bookings (like for using the laser cutter).

**If you:**
* do not show up for a booked appointment
* are more than 10 minutes late to a booked appointment
* give less than 12 hours notice to cancel a booked appointment

We will charge your payment method on file a no show fee. This fee depends on your membership plan:

Maker Lite: **$20**
Maker Plus: **$25**
Coworker Lite/Plus: **$35**


## Tool Usage Fees
Some tools may incur usage fees to cover maintenance costs and consumables usage. Most tools are included in your membership, but please check its wiki page to avoid any surprises.

If you fail to pay for tool usage within a reasonable amount of time (generally considered 7 days) we may terminate your membership and attempt to recover the costs from your payment method on file. 

Here is a list of tools with usage fees:
* [Lasercutter](/tools/digifab/lasercutter) $10/hr BYO material
* [3D Printers (Filament)](/tools/digifab/adventurer4) $2/hr or $40/kg - filament included
* [3D Printers (Resin)](/tools/digifab/elegoomars2pro) $3/hr - resin included
* [CNC Router](/tools/digifab/cncrouter) - new tool, currently free until we work it out :)
