# Introduction
To maintain a safe operating environment, Brisbane Makerspace requires that members undertake training (called an induction) before they can use some tools. We use a 3 level traffic light system to indicate the different requirements. These are "Green Tool", "Yellow Tool", and "Red Tool".

**Members are not allowed to operate a tool if they have not completed the induction requirements.**

*Every* tool has either an A4 label with a written note stating the tool's colour or it will have a small colour coded label. For example, the Cricut has a green coloured label on it, indicating that it's a "Green Tool" and the laser cutter has a yellow sticker on it.

If a tool does not have a label on it, then it has been deemed very low risk and it doesn't require documentation or induction (for example, scissors).

# Green Tool
These tools require no special induction as they have been deemed low risk. Members are allowed to use these tools without any special training requirements. It is still a requirement to read and understand its wiki page if it exists.

# Yellow Tool
These tools have been deemed a medium risk, and a formal induction is required. There are two types of inductions and a tool may require either or both of them. These are an online component (usually a short video and quiz), and an in-person component where you are asked to demonstrate your competency in operating the tool.

Each Yellow Tool is different, so you should carefully read its wiki page to understand its induction requirements.

# Red Tool
This is a high-risk tool. Members are not allowed to operate Red Tool tools without supervision from an authorised supervisor (usually staff). However, our staff are more than happy to assist you by either operating this tool for you or supervising your use of it.
