# Restricted Resources
All resources at BMS are accessible to Ordinary Members by default. This page outlines a list of resources that are considered restricted, and who is permitted to access them.

To avoid confusion, teams are able to restrict access to physical resources they are accountable for for safety or maintenance reasons. It is up to teams to decide how this happens.

Resources should not be restricted unless a restriction on access or use can be reasonably justified. If access to a restricted resource is to be removed from someone, they must be notified at the time of removal, or preferably at least 24 hours in advance.

To gain access to a restricted resource, you can apply to the manager of that resource. This request must not be declined unless it can be reasonably justified (ie a request to join the executive mailing list may be declined for members not on the executive). The manager should promptly remove access to a resource (and send a notification of such) once a member is no longer eligible for access a restricted resource.
