# Introduction
We try to foster a fun, safe and collaborative environment at Brisbane Makerspace. To assist us, we have a list of policies and rules that everyone is required to follow. If you are using our physical space, attending a workshop, or using our digital resources, these rules apply to you.

Our policies may change at any time. Significant changes will be anounced to members via email.

The three pillars of our culture can be summarised as:
* be respectful
* be honest
* make good choices

# Policies
Under the Associations Act and our constitution, the association can make by-laws that are enforcable and apply to all members. We refer to these as "policies" and they can be found below.
