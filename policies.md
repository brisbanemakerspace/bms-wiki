# Introduction
We try to foster a fun, safe and collaborative environment at Brisbane Makerspace. To assist us, we have a list of policies and rules that everyone is required to follow. If you are using our physical space, attending a workshop, or using our discord/forum, these rules apply to you.

Our policies may change at any time by a vote at a general meeting. Significant changes will be anounced to members via email.

Our constitution is a special document that governs how BMS Inc. runs. It contains the rules and procedures for how the organisation is legally required to function.

Once it has been approved by the office of fair trading, this sentence will be removed.
