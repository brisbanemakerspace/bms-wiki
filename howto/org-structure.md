# What type of group is Brisbane Makerspace?
Brisbane Makerspace is a trading name of Meanjin Makerspace Inc. However we often use BMS or "the space" to refer to the group. We are an incorporated association, incorporated under the State of Queensland's Incorporated Associations Act. Meanjin Makerspace Inc. is it's own separate legal entity just like a person or a business. The Meanjin Makerspace Inc. [Constitution](/policies/constitution) is the legally binding document that controls how we operate.

The [Constitution](/policies/constitution) requires a special resolution to make changes to, and approval by the Office of Fair trading to enact. In addition to the constitution, we have various by-laws that the association creates from time to time to manage the operations of the association. These by-laws are called our "policies" and can be changed at a general meeting.

# Governance Groups
Like most organisations, we have different groups of people who are responsible for different things. The sections below explain all the groups of people we have.

## Management Committee
The management committee (or just committee for short) is responsible for the *administration* and *governance* of the association and is accountable to *all Volunteer Members*. These are defined in section 17 of our constitution.

### President
The president’s primary responsibility is to ensure that the management committee governs effectively and to help the association pursue its objects.

**The president’s functions include, but are not limited to:**
- facilitating meetings and discussions for the association
- contributing to the culture and direction of the association
- guiding the association towards furthering its objects
- representing the association to key stakeholders

### Secretary
The secretary’s primary responsibility is to ensure that the management committee operates in a way that is compliant with the association's rules and by-laws.

**The secretary’s functions include, but are not limited to:**
- calling meetings of the association, including preparing notices of a meeting and of the business to be conducted at the meeting in consultation with the president of the association
- keeping minutes of each meeting
- keeping copies of all correspondence and other documents relating to the association

### Treasurer
The treasurer’s primary responsibility is to ensure that the association and management committee operates its finances in a way that is compliant with the association's rules and by-laws.

**The treasurer’s functions include, but are not limited to:**

The other committee members (if elected) are responsible for supporting the management committee and providing balanced views during discussions.

**Their functions include, but are not limited to:**
- assisting the management committee as directed/needed
- attending and contributing to committee meetings, etc.


## Head maker
The head maker is responsible for the association *operations*, not *management* or *governance*. They require extensive technical knowledge and experience with our tools, facilities and community and work closely with all governance groups.

**The head maker’s functions include, but are not limited to:**
  - managing the day to day operations of the association including but not limited to things like ordering new supplies, onboarding new members, completing safety inductions and responding to membership/public inquiries
  - facilitating community engagement and support
  - keeping Working Groups accountable to their purpose
  - other necessary operational functions of the association

## Working Groups
The Working Groups are responsible for both the *administration* and *operations* of certain parts of the association and are accountable to the *head maker*. These are things like safety, digital fabrication, electronics, infrastructure, etc. You can see the list of Working Groups [here](/working-groups).

## Volunteer Members
All members who are entitled to vote are called Volunteer Members and are responsible for keeping everyone above accountable and approving changes to rules, roles, etc.

## Standard Members (non-voting)
These are all the other people who are members of the association, but do not have voting rights and don't have any direct input into it's governance. However, non-voting members are entitled to access our facilities and observe any general meetings.

# Membership Classes
Everyone who's officially part of the organisation must be a member. We have 3 different membership classes. These are written into our [Constitution](/policies/constitution) under section 5.

## Standard Member (non-voting)
- is entitled to access the association’s resources and facilities in line with any relevant by-laws
- is entitled to attend a general meeting as an observer but is **not entitled to a vote** at a general meeting
- may be part of a Working Group

## Volunteer Member
- is entitled to access the association’s resources and facilities in line with any relevant by-laws
- is entitled to one vote at a general meeting
- may be part of a Working Group
- must meet the following requirements:
  - held membership of the association for at least 3 months
  - requires a motion to be passed at a committee or general meeting supporting the application to become a Volunteer Member
  - have in place a signed volunteer agreement committing to perform certain volunteer task(s)


## Lifetime Member

- must meet the following requirements:

  - demonstrate a lifetime contribution to the association as determined by a motion passed at a general meeting
  - the requirement in the sub-section above may be reduced by a procedural motion passed at a general meeting for someone who was a member of the unincorporated association prior to incorporation
  - in the sub-section above, a lifetime contribution is equally based on the time, cultural, and monetary value of an individual’s contributions to the association. It is defined as having a profound and positive impact on the association that’s likely to be remembered for the majority of its lifetime. Generally, 10 years of being an active volunteer meets this requirement.
