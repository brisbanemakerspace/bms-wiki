# How to create an induction in BMS Learn (Moodle)
BMS Learn is our inductions platform - which is just the name of our Moodle instance. All of our tools that carry reasonable levels of risk require induction. When setting up a new tool that's been acquired, an induction is required before members can use it. Follow the guide below to create a new tool in moodle so that members can learn how to use it.

## 0. Get the right permissions
Before you can do anything in this guide, you need the right permissions. We use single sign on which means you already have an account, just [tap here](https://learn.brisbanemaker.space) to login using the member portal.

***After*** you've logged in at least once, please reach out to someone on the infrastructure team or committee to adjust your permissions. We'll need to assign a role that allows you to create and edit Moodle courses.

## 1. Create a new course
Each induction is called a course in Moodle. To do create a new one, follow the steps below.

1. [Tap here](https://learn.brisbanemaker.space/course/edit.php) to open the new course form.
2. Update the "General" course settings like in the screenshot below. Fill in the two course name fields, select the correct category and **deselect the course end date**.

3. Scroll down and add a short description and image of the tool (you can just copy these from the wiki page).

4. Scroll down and tap "Save and display" to continue.

## 2. Hide announcements
By default, Moodle shows an announcements category in the course. We don't use this so let's hide it.

1. After creating/opening the new course, click on "Announcements".

2. Open the settings tab, scroll down to the "Common module settings" and expand it. Now change "Availability" to "Hide on course page".
