# Introduction
We have three combined soldering and hot air stations with digital temperature control.

# Recommended Uses
This is a great general purpose soldering iron as it has an adjustable soldering temperature. We have small and medium sized tips which are great for a variety of different soldering tasks.

The hot air stations also have different sized tips/nozzles and are great for using on heat shrink and SMT parts. The air flow rate and temperature are also adjustable.

# Specifications
**Induction Class:** 🟡 Yellow Tool (Induction Required)
**Temp Range:** 100 - 480°C
**Max Air Flow:** 24L/min

# Induction Process
**⚠️ This tool requires an induction before use.**

To book an induction for this machine, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

> Warning: soldering irons and hot air can become extremely hot and result in severe burns if touched.

## Before Use
1. Allow the hot air or soldering iron to reach temperature.
2. Clean the soldering iron tip in the steel wool once heated up.

## During Use
1. Never leave the soldering iron or hot air sitting on the bench. Always return them to their holders when not in your hands.
2. Pay careful attention not to touch the soldering iron tip or direct the hot air onto your skin or other things like wire insulation, etc.
3. For soldering, hold both things together (or use a soldering third hand) and heat them with the iron. Slowly push soldering wire into the joint and allow it to become covered in solder. Keep the soldered joint still until it has cooled down.
4. For hot air, carefully direct the hot air around the heat shrink or component, avoiding other components/wires nearby. 

## After Use
1. Wipe down the soldering iron tip in the steel wool and return the tool(s) to their holder(s).
2. Remove all bits of loose heat shrink, wires, insulation cutoffs, etc. from the work area.
