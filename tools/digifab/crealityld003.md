# Recommended Uses
Resin printers have a fairly small build area when compared to traditional FDM printers and the process is messy and inconvenient. This one however is pretty huge! This printer is suitable when detail and quality is the most important thing. Our resin printer is suitable for printing prototype parts, miniature figurines, etc.

# Specifications
**Usage Cost:** $2/hr

**Induction Class:** 🔴 Red Tool (Supervised Use Required)
**Print Area:** 192mm(L) x 120mm(W) x 230mm(H)
**Print Speed:** 6 - 18s / layer

# Induction Process
This tool is a "Red Tool" which means it can only be used under supervision. Once you have enough experience operating this machine, you may be offered unsupervised access.

**🔴 This tool requires an induction before use.**

To book an induction / time to use this machine, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

## Before Use
1. Remove the UV cover **then** put on safety glasses and nitrile gloves.
2. Check the vat has enough resin in it (refill or change resin here), and the build plate/vat are securely fastened. Remove your PPE and replace the UV cover.
2. Using the Brisbane Makerspace iMac, open your job with the "3D Creator" software. On the right hand side click on "Settings" then make sure the right colour profile is selected from the dropdown menu at the top.

## During Use
1. Keep the UV cover closed on the machine at all times.
2. Keep an eye on it to make sure the print hasn't failed.

## After Use
1. Wait at least 5 minutes after print finishes. Remove the UV cover from both the printer and the curing station. Open the container of IPA and place on the curing station.
2. Put on safety glasses and nitrile gloves.
3. Loosen the build plate knob and transfer it to the holder above the IPA container.
4. Remove safety glasses and nitrile gloves, then replace both UV covers. Start the curing station in wash mode for 10 minutes.
5. Remove both UV covers **then** put on safety glasses and nitrile gloves. Remove the build plate and close the container of IPA. Place the acrylic disc on the curing station, remove your job from the build plate, and place your job in the center. Put the build plate back on the printer.
6. Remove safety glasses and nitrile gloves, **then** replace the UV cover. Start the curing station in cure mode for 2 minutes (for thin prints) to 8 minutes (for very thick prints).
7. Check to make sure there is no uncured resin, then remove the UV cover on the curing station, remove your job, then replace the UV cover.

# Approved Materials
3D printer resins are highly toxic and require specialised chemicals and procedures to safely use them. As a result, we do not allow members to bring in their own 3D printer resins to use except with special prior approval.

We stock Nova3D "standard" and eSun ABS-like resin in various colours (usually black, grey, and transparent blue). If you'd like to use a different resin, please let us know and we can order it in to keep on hand.
