# Introduction
We have two Bambu Lab A1 minis (one with an Automatic Material Selector and one without) that are great for printing PLA and PETG filaments. They feature auto bed leveling, vibration and flow-rate compensation, auto-runout detection, and motor noise cancellation.

# Safety Information

## Potential Hazards

|Potential Hazard|Details|
|---|---|
|[![Entanglement Warning Symbol](/sops/warning-icons/entanglement.png =100x)<div>Entanglement</div>](#)|The 3D printers have a moving print bed and hotend that can entangle hair or loose clothing.|
|[![Hot Surface Warning Symbol](/sops/warning-icons/hot-surface.svg =100x)<div>Hot Surface</div>](#)|The nozzle and print bed can reach temperatures above 50°C, which can cause 1st and 2nd degree burns.|
|[![Crushing of Hands Warning Symbol](/sops/warning-icons/hand-injury-press.png =100x)<div>Danger of Crush Injuries</div>](#)|The print bed, X-axis and hotend move quickly and can result in appendages being crushed.|
|[![Sharp Element Warning Symbol](/sops/warning-icons/sharp_element.png =100x)<div>Sharp Element</div>](#)|The purge wiper (left-hand side of printer) has a blunt serated edge that could cause injury if enough pressure is applied to the skin.|

## Prohibitions

|Prohibition|Details|
|---|---|
|[![No Reaching In Prhibition Symbol](/sops/prohibition-icons/no-reaching-in.svg =100x)<div>No Reaching In</div>](#)|Do not reach into the printer work envelope while the printer is active. Pause or stop the current job before reaching into the working envelope.|

# Slicing Software
These printers require the use of the Bambu Studio slicing software. This software is very easy to use and allows connection to our printers via WiFi.

Bambu Studio is installed on our iMac ready to go (bring your model on a USB flash drive, send it via AirDrop, or login to google drive etc.). However, you can also install it on your own computer in order to get an estimate on printing time, or to send print jobs directly from your own laptop. Bambu Studio supports macOS, Windows and Linux.

> It is possible to use OrcaSlicer, an open-source fork of Bambu Studio, with the A1 mini. However, we cannot support you if you run into issues while using OrcaSlicer.

## Connecting via Bambu Slicer

You may be required to enter a access code for the printers when you try to connect to them from Bambu Slicer. Enter the appropriate access code as written below.

|Printer Name|Access Code|

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

## Before Use

> New before use checklist coming soon
{.is-info}

### Changing Filament in AMS


## During Use
1. Check on the printer once every 30 minutes if you're on site. If you wish to leave a print unattended, please post a message in Discord as a courtesy.
2. Regularly check the object has not come off the build plate and it's still printing correctly.

## After Use
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently flex the print bed to release your object. You may need to use a spatula to help it off.
3. Clean up all bits of loose filament / plastic from around the print area, and gently use side cutters to remove excess plastic from the print bed.

## Troubleshooting

|Issue|Cause|Resolution|
|---|---|---|
|Object has wisp/strands of plastic coming off the surface|Hotend temperature is too high for the filament material|Check the maximum and optimal temperature of the filament and match those settings in your slicer|

# Brisbane Makerspace Stocked Materials
We try to keep the following filaments in stock for members to use but check ahead of time if you need something specific. Filament is included in the hourly machine cost. We recommend using these unless you have a special need, as they've been chosen to work well with our machines and have calibrated profiles. If you'd like to suggest other filaments to stock, please let us know.
