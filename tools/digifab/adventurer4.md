Our Adventurer 4 is a mid size, highly capable machine. It's enclosed print area and two nozzle choices make it ideal for printing high quality ABS prints without warping.

# Recommended Uses
Our Adventurer 4 can be used for printing many different objects. It's setup to print with ABS or PLA which gives a great surface finish, and strong, structurally sound parts. Use it for printing brackets, enclosures and other small parts. For faster and cheaper prints, swap out the standard 0.4mm nozzle for a 0.6mm nozzle. You can also print high temperature filaments like ABS, PLA, PC, PETG, PLA-CF or PETG-CF. Note that we only keep ABS and PLA in stock, BYO for other filament types.

## Before Use
1. Prepare your model by downloading or exporting it in `.stl` format.
2. Open the "FlashPrint" software on our iMac and import your model by clicking on "Load" and selecting your file.
3. Click on "Print" then select `ABS` or `PLA`, then select the "standard" print profile.
4. Click on "OK", then select "Send GCode" if you're happy with the print time.
5. Watch the printer until the first layer is finished, then you can go work on something else!

## During Use
1. Check on the printer once every 30 minutes at a minimum. If you wish to leave a print unattended, please send staff a message via Discord and confirm they are aware of your print before leaving.
2. Regularly check the object has not come off the build plate and it's still printing correctly.

## After Use
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently flex the print bed to release your object. You may need to use a spatula to help it off.
3. Clean up all bits of loose filament / plastic from around the print area, and gently use side cutters to remove excess plastic from the print bed.

# Brisbane Makerspace Stocked Materials
We try to keep the following filaments in stock for members to use. Filament is included in the hourly machine cost. We recommend using these unless you have a special need, as they've been chosen to work well with our machines and have calibrated profiles. If you'd like to suggest other filaments to stock, please let us know.
