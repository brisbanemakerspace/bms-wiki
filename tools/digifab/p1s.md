# Introduction
We have a Bambu P1S that is great for printing most types of filaments due to it's high temperature hotend and enclosure. It has auto bed leveling, vibration and flow-rate compensation, auto-runout detection, motor noise cancellation and a 4 roll AMS system for multi colour printing.
