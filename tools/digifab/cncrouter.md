# Recommended Uses
The CNC router is great for all sorts of things like making detailed 3D models, large project enclosures and general cutting/engraving. It can cut and engrave things large or small, and most types of materials including plastic, timber and soft metals like aluminium. Please note that it cannot be used with very hard materials like steel.

## Endmills / Router Bits
We do not provide any router bits because they are expensive and break easily. It is your responsibility to source compatible router bits and bring them with you. Our induction fee includes 2x router bits so you can get started right away, but they aren't suitable for every material/project.

We highly recommend that you source your router bits from [CNC 3D](https://www.cnc3d.com.au). They are based on the Gold Coast, and all of their bits are already included in our endmill library. You can find their bits available online below. They ship with express shipping or have local pick up.

## Software
We use CarveCo and have a license for CarveCo Maker installed on the CNC Computer. This computer is setup just for running this CNC machine, and generally shouldn't be used for other purposes.

This software is called "CAM" software and is not capable of designing models - you need to use CAD software like Tinkercad or Fusion 360. CAM software is very difficult and complex to use. Prior to organising an induction your should at minimum, watch ALL of these videos.

# Induction Process
This tool requires an induction! It's loud and messy, and can cause serious injury or damage if used incorrectly.

Our induction process requires a payment of $30, but includes 2 endmill bits used during the induction that you get to keep. You must read this entire wiki page, and watch every video listed above ***before*** booking in.
