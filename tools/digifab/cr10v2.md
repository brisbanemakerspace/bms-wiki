You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

> Warning: the heated bed and hot end can become extremely hot and result in severe burns if touched.

## Before Use
1. Prepare your model by downloading or exporting it in `.stl` format.
2. Open the "PrusaSlicer" software on our iMac and import your model by clicking on the add object button and selecting your file.
3. On the right side of the window, select your print setting ("CR-10 FAST", or "CR-10 SLOW"). Printing with the slow profile will yield better results but take longer. Select your filament - either ABS or PLA.
4. Click on "Slice Now", then click the send to printer button (looks like ![ps-button.png](/digitalfabrication/ps-button.png =x20) ) if you're happy with the print time.
5. Watch the printer until the first layer is finished, then you can go work on something else!

## During Use
1. Check on the printer once every 30 minutes at a minimum.
2. Regularly check the object has not come off the build plate and it's still printing correctly.

## After Use
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently try to pull you print off the bed. Do not flex the glass bed. You may need to use a spatula to help it off.
3. Clean up all bits of loose filament / plastic from around the print area before leaving.

# Brisbane Makerspace Stocked Materials
We try to keep the following filaments in stock for members to use. Filament is included in the hourly machine cost. We recommend using these unless you have a special need, as they've been chosen to work well with our machines and have calibrated profiles. If you'd like to suggest other filaments to stock, please let us know.
