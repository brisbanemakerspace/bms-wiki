# Introduction
Our Creator 3 is a large, highly capable machine. It's enclosed print area and independent high temp dual extruders make it ideal for printing many materials or adding water disolvable supports.

# Recommended Uses
Our Creator 3 can be used for printing many different objects. It's setup to print with ABS or PLA which gives a great surface finish, and strong, structurally sound parts. Use it for printing brackets, enclosures and other small parts. You can also print high temperature filaments! Note that we only keep ABS and PLA in stock, BYO for other filament types.

# Induction Process
**🟡 This tool requires an induction before use.**

To book an induction for this machine, please use the "book appointment" link from the [member portal](https://portal.brisbanemaker.space).

# Slicing Software
These printers require the use of the Flashprint slicing software. This software is very easy to use and allows connection to our printers via WiFi.

Flashprint is installed on our iMac ready to go (bring your model on a USB flash drive, send it via AirDrop, or login to google drive etc.). However, you can also install it on your own computer in order to get an estimate on printing time, or to send print jobs directly from your own laptop. Flashprint supports macOS, Windows and Linux.

# How To Operate
You should be familiar with how to operate this tool after completing an induction. However, a quick reference guide is included below to assist you.

> Warning: the heated bed and hot end can become extremely hot and result in severe burns if touched.

## Before Use
1. Prepare your model by downloading or exporting it in `.stl` format.
2. Open the "FlashPrint" software on our iMac and import your model by clicking on "Load" and selecting your file.
3. Click on "Print" then select `ABS` or `PLA` etc., then select the "standard" print profile.
4. Click on "OK", then select "Send GCode" if you're happy with the print time.
5. Watch the printer until the first layer is finished, then you can go work on something else!

## During Use
1. Check on the printer once every 30 minutes if you're on site. If you wish to leave a print unattended, please post a message in Discord as a courtesy.
2. Regularly check the object has not come off the build plate and it's still printing correctly.

## After Use
1. Wait for the print bed to cool down before removing it.
2. Gently flex the print bed to release your object. You may need to use a spatula to help it off.
3. Clean up all bits of loose filament / plastic from around the print area, and gently use side cutters to remove excess plastic from the print bed.

# How to level / calibrate Z offset
Found from a very helpful [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FlashForge/comments/12rsbt5/guide_tramming_levelling_on_a_creator_3/) that seems to work well.

1. First clean your nozzles so they are pristine, that tiny bit of filament might trigger the sensor early and ruin everything.
2. Run the level option on the main menu, select left extruder, complete it.
3. Run the level option on the main menu, select right extruder, if there are ANY changes, as in did it ask you to turn one of the knobs, complete it and run level on the left extruder again, then right again until it completes without knob/nut changes.
4. Run Z-calibration, use your feeler gauge* and use the height you normally print at (** see note), if you print at 0.20, use that gauge, put it flat on the bed and let the nozzle hit it.
5. Turn on 9 point mesh level and run it, don’t use your gauge just let it do its thing.
6. Optional: turn on 9 point before each print, I do this and I find it helps when you accidentally put your plate at a slightly weird angle clipping the guide bits.

# Brisbane Makerspace Stocked Materials
We try to keep the following filaments in stock for members to use but check ahead of time if you need something specific. Filament is included in the hourly machine cost. We recommend using these unless you have a special need, as they've been chosen to work well with our machines and have calibrated profiles. If you'd like to suggest other filaments to stock, please let us know.

## Other
The above is what we try to keep always stocked. However, there's also tonnes of other random colours, textures and sometimes materials like flexible TPU. Be sure to check the filament storage area for an up to date list.
