# How to use
Please book in a time with a staff member to use.

Attach the FLIR ONE Pro to the bottom of your iOS device (with lightning port). Press the power button to turn the FLIR ONE Pro on and wait for it to boot up (green LED).

Download the "FLIR ONE" app, and open it. After approximately 30 seconds the app should start showing the thermal camera feed. Please consult the app's user manual for more information on how to use the app and features like spot metering etc.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having trouble getting the camera to work, first check that it's charged (light should turn on and flash when the button is pressed) or try restarting your device. If you're still having trouble, book an appointment with a staff member and we can get you setup.
