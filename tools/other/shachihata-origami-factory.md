# Introduction

There are very few tools created and used in origami/paperfolding. The Shachihata Origami Factory ZPC-AF2/H is one that has popped up every now and then, although the reviews about how useful this tool is has been mixed. But for those who don't want to use a good scalpel and a metal ruler on a self-annealing cutting mat, or just want to see how this works, this gadget might just be for you.

Before you regret using this tool, read some comments that people on Reddit have said about it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/origami/comments/1eq4mbc/a_tool_that_cuts_paper_into_square_sheets_where/

This tool is stored in the plastic container with all the paper related craft materials and tools. The BMS has a pink coloured version of this tool, but you can see what it looks like here (can't upload image - Jaimyn please help)

# Operating Instructions

## Before Use

1. If you can understand Japanese, the full operating instruction is printed on the base where the paper is to be placed.
2. Make sure that the clear plastic tool is sitting flat on the base and not lifted as it is a poking hazard. 
3. Make sure that the size of the paper is large enough for the tool to cut with. Depending on the thickness (e.g. gsm) and the texture, it may be more appropriate to cut using other implements.
4. Make sure that you use the tool on a flat and non-slippery surface.
5. If you have not used the tool before, or if you are cutting a particular type of paper for the first time, always test the strength of the paper on the cutting tool first to make sure that it can provide a clean cut.


## During Use

> Always be mindful of where the point of the cutting tool is. This will prevent any injuries caused by the sharp point.
{.is-warning}

Please read through all of the instructions.

1. Lift the clear plastic cutting tool from the base using the handle.
2. Slide the piece of paper under the cutting tool, and square it against the two edges of the base.
3. Push the clear plastic cutting tool down, and place pressure on the position indicated by the white circle on the top right hand side.
4. While pressing down on the cutting tool and holding onto the top right hand corner of the paper, use a smooth motion to pull the paper towards you in a diagonal motion to the left.
5. The cutting tool should then make an incision in the paper with the point on the cutting tool and then cut the two side of the paper so that you are left with a square.
6. Lift the cutting tool and remove the (hopefully) square piece of paper.

## After Use

1. Make sure that the cutting tool is lying flat against the base and not lifted up.
2. Return it to the plastic box for paper materials and tools.
3. Clean up any paper off cuts.
