# How to use
It's flat packed and stored under the shelves in the electronics bench corner.

To setup, carefully slide the backdrops and lightbox out of the bag. Expand the lightbox and fold up the internal space to keep it up. Plug in the USB cable to a USB port (there are some on the desks in the general hot desk area). Use the inline buttons to adjust the brightness and colour temperature.

# Troubleshooting
If you're having trouble setting this up, book an appointment with staff or feel free to ask in Discord.
