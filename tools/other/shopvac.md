# Specifications
**Induction Class:** Green Tool (No Induction Required)
**Storage Volume:** 20L

# How to use
Unwind the cord fully, then plug in and switch on. Use just like a normal vacuum cleaner! However, this shopvac can happily suck up "wet" things and liquids, unlike a normal vacuum. Please wind up the cord and return to it's home after use.
